✓ Have atleast 5 very active or 10 semi-active players minimum
✓ Have an army of atleast 5 people who are ready, properly armed and skilled to defend their homeland
✓ Have infrastructure such as: Public housing, plumbing, transportation, access to clean water and food, basic human rights,
✓ Wealth and military power
✓ Have a nicely built main city/any kind of headquarters for your nation (Keep it mildly realistic please - No need to copy a military base but do not build your base inside a 3D minion art
✓ Have a name and a flag for your country
✓ Have a political ideology of your choice

> **Non-recognized nation (NRN)** 

Non-recognized nations are basically considered small tribes of people. You are free to do whatever you want but don’t start wars as a very small unrecognized nation made up of 2-3 of your friends. Try and claim new land, explore and make your way towards building a glorious empire… or you can just stay as an unrecognized nomad tribe if you wish to

**• War rules & regulations**

o Do not start unneccesarry conflicts with other
o The aim of the server is to bring people together, not just create 1,000 small nations then start pointless wars.
o Before starting wars with other countries you must come up with a lightly roleplayed battle plan, information about how the battle will be executed and why you are starting said war in the first place.
o All wars must start with a declaration of war (from both sides) and a peacetime period of 24-48 hours of which will be dedicated to getting ready for the war.
o A war must be fair (aka: both have the same or similiar gear, so that a fair war can at least be made)
o A war, before being declarated, must have a precise and clear reason (aka: someone got killed, someone destroyed something), not something like (we hate them because they're not cool)
o The winner will get a prize, of course discussed and decided between the two parties. The winner cannot claim a whole country.
o No torture, No ransoming, You cannot combat after dying

## CHAPTER III. ROLEPLAY TERMS

• *What is roleplay?* – act out or perform the part of a person or character, for example as a technique in training or psychotherapy

• *In-character* - In-character (or IC) is anything the characters do inside the roleplay. It is the opposite of out-of-character. • What does my character know IC? o If you're the King, you know the names of your knights. You do not know how to build or craft. The King would never have been taught this. Same goes for the Knights and Priest. o If you're a Knight, you know the names of the other knights. o If you're a Guard, you know the names of the other guards. o If you're an Archer, you know the names of the other archers. o Everyone knows the name of the King. • Out-of-character - Out-of-character (or OOC) is anything outside of the roleplay.
